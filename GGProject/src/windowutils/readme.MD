### Active window info

#### Usage
Function `ActiveWindowInfo.getActiveWindowInfo()` returns a `WindowInfo`
object containing `x` and `y` coordinates of window's upper left corner
and it's `width` and `height`. To extract those fields, 
use corresponding getters (`getX()`, `getY()`, `getWidth()`, `getHeight()`). 

`WindowInfo` object is assigned to window's id. 
To update coordinates of that window, use `update()` method.
